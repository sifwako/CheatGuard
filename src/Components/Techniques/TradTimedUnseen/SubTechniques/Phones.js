          . Cheaters can hide their device from the proctor's view, for
          instance, by placing it against the computer screen. Moreover, they
          can exploit voice-activated assistants like Siri or Google Assistant
          to obtain answers audibly by simply saying a voice command. This
          method allows cheaters to access information without typing or making
          their device visible, posing a challenge for maintaining academic
          integrity in online assessments.
